## Abstract (Excerpt)

The present study, which is a brain-computer interface for
classifying shape mental imagery, a subject on which there is little existing
research. The goal of the study is to replicate the classification accuracy results of
Esfahani & Sundararajan, particularly Experiment 1.2, in which researchers were
able to classify the five shapes with a 44.6% average accuracy across all
participants (n = 10). We performed an extension to this study that employs
similar preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification methods, but using a
standard wet EEG system with 64 electrodes, as compared to the dry 14-
electrode wireless system used in the original study. We hypothesized that the
addition of both more electrodes as well as the use of the conductive gel that
gives "wet" EEG systems their names will significantly increase classification
accuracy of the five shapes. Results showed that, in fact, overall classification
accuracy was comparable (43.3%) to the 14-electrode system, even in a second
experiment that increased the number of trials. These findings support the
growing evidence that portable, dry EEG systems are equally as reliable as
traditional systems for brain-computer interface use.
